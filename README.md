# School-Of-Code-Final-Project-Nesst

For my final project at School Of Code bootcamp, my team and I were tasked to create an application to help travellers connect and 
book shared accommodation. We used Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Jest and Cyprus.

If you want to view our app, here is the <a href="https://nesst.vercel.app/">link</a> and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyPIFCDmNHA&ab_channel=NesstProject">Promo Video</a>.

Some Inages from our application:
